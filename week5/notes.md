# Week 5 Lecture - FSW125

Learnign goals for weeks 5 & 6 => Now that we have hands on experience with node and express a general refresh to cement important topics from weeks past while filling in any gaps that were missed from previous lectures. Our main goal here is to prepare ourselves for the capstone project and fill in any knowledge gaps. Anything not covered today can be covered in week 7 lecture where there will be little to any new material.

## Agenda

    1) Week's 3 - 4 Recap
    2) Capstone
    3) Middleware
    4) URL Parameters & Queries 
    5) Questions

### 1. Week's 3 - 4 Recap

- HTTP Req, Res Cycle
- Express.js
- Nodemon
- REST

### 2. Capstone

### 3. Middleware

Express is a routing and middleware web framework that has minimal functionality of its own: An Express application is essentially a series of middleware function calls.

Middleware functions are functions that have access to the request object (req), the response object (res), and the next middleware function in the applicationâ€™s request-response cycle. The next middleware function is commonly denoted by a variable named next.

Middleware functions can perform the following tasks:

- Execute any code.
- Make changes to the request and the response objects.
- End the request-response cycle.
- Call the next middleware function in the stack.

If the current middleware function does not end the request-response cycle, it must call next() to pass control to the next middleware function. Otherwise, the request will be left hanging.

### 4. URL Parameters & Queries

[Anatomy of a URL](https://doepud.co.uk/blog/anatomy-of-a-url)

#### Parts of a URL

- Base: http://www.amazon.com
- Endpoint: http://www.amazon.com/images
- Parameter: http://www.amazon.com/images/1skcasnjasndjsn

*see assets*

    accessible via req.params & req.query in key:value formatted objects

In the above example **1skcasnjasndjsn** is the parameter and the value of our key:value pair.

URL parameters are used to create a "GET ONE" route and would look like this with **movieId** being the key and inserted via a wildcard syntax(colon before), somethign we should be familiar with from react router match params.

```Javascript
movieRouter.get(":movieId", (req, res) => {
    //some stuff
})
```

#### Query String (typically used to filter results)

- Begins with the "?"
- Built of key:value pairs
- Multiple queries seperated with the "&"

Here is an example of a URL with query strings attached:

    https://stackabuse.com/?page=2&limit=3

    The query parameters are the actual key-value pairs like page and limit with values of 2 and 3, respectively.

Your query parameters can be retrieved from the query object on the request object sent to your route (req.query). It is in the form of an object in which you can directly access the query parameters you care about. In this case Express handles all of the URL parsing for you and exposes the retrieved parameters as this object.
